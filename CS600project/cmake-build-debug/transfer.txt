written
on
sunday

i
kept
my
mouth
shut
about
bitcoin
on
my
blog
so
far
but
i
do
feel
like
i
need
to
bring
it
up
now
because
of
how
many
comments
and
mail
i
got
about
a
bug
report
i
wrote
two
weeks
ago
for
removing
projects
of
mine
from
a
bounty
website
called
tip
commitit
feels
like
you
are
not
allowed
to
say
anything
other
than
quot
bitcoin
is
amazing
quot
on
the
internet
without
getting
loads
of
negative
comments
i
found
that
quite
interesting
because
i
did
not
actually
have
anything
against
bitcoin
in
this
particular
case
however
to
have
a
place
to
point
future
hate
mail
against
this
is
why
i
m
less
than
lukewarm
about
bitcoin
my
problemthe
actual
problem
i
had
was
not
that
there
was
bitcoin
involved
in
and
by
itself
the
problem
was
on
one
hand
something
i
did
not
opt
into
and
there
not
being
a
way
to
opt
out
of
this
tipping
system
and
that
it
s
a
completely
unregulated
space
that
can
cause
me
troubles
i
could
have
avoided
otherwise
as
of
why
that
is
the
case
i
believe
i
need
to
provide
a
bit
of
explanation
because
i
feel
like
the
base
assumptions
that
people
have
that
wrote
me
mail
are
completely
different
from
mine
and
no
sensible
discussion
can
be
had
in
that
situation
the
world
i
live
inso
let
me
explain
you
a
bit
in
which
world
i
grew
up
i
was
born
and
raised
in
austria
spent
some
time
in
london
before
going
back
to
austria
money
in
austria
and
many
other
european
countries
works
different
than
in
the
united
states
where
most
comments
on
the
internet
come
from
how
big
those
differences
are
cannot
be
expressed
because
it
affects
everything
in
your
life
austrians
pay
a
lot
of
taxes
how
much
taxes
we
pay
is
very
hard
to
grasp
even
as
an
austrian
because
unless
you
are
running
a
company
you
often
do
not
even
see
all
the
costs
that
are
associated
with
your
salary
taxes
and
other
things
are
split
into
roughly
three
categories
social
security
employer
costs
and
income
taxes
those
things
are
actually
not
called
that
way
in
austria
but
since
this
is
an
english
blog
post
i
will
stick
with
it
your
employer
pays
you
social
security
and
other
employer
costs
which
includes
medical
insurance
and
contributions
to
the
pension
system
and
many
other
things
these
payments
cover
all
kinds
of
things
that
are
related
to
human
beings
for
instance
if
a
woman
gets
pregnant
and
stops
working
those
payments
come
of
a
pool
of
money
that
was
allocated
through
these
measures
each
child
in
austria
gets
support
payments
from
the
state
and
so
forth
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
are
paid
out
of
the
pool
of
things
you
do
not
see
normally
from
the
amount
that
you
get
in
the
end
you
also
pay
taxes
those
taxes
are
used
for
highways
kindergartens
schools
universities
and
lots
of
other
things
the
reason
i
bring
this
up
is
because
our
taxes
are
very
high
but
i
get
something
for
that
money
it
might
not
be
the
perfect
system
and
there
are
lots
of
things
about
it
that
make
me
furious
but
i
do
not
see
a
reason
why
i
would
want
to
stop
paying
taxes
it
s
not
just
taxes
that
are
different
though
credit
is
different
too
very
different
in
fact
credit
scores
exist
here
but
the
lack
of
one
does
not
deny
you
services
that
s
also
because
it
is
very
hard
to
get
a
credit
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
very
important
though
because
credit
cards
are
not
nearly
as
relevant
here
as
elsewhere
you
still
kinda
need
a
credit
card
for
online
payments
but
they
don
t
really
give
you
credit
all
austrian
credit
cards
i
have
ever
seen
with
the
exception
of
american
express
charge
of
a
linked
bank
account
on
a
certain
day
if
you
use
the
card
for
more
money
than
is
available
on
your
account
it
puts
your
account
into
overdraft
and
you
pay
the
overdraft
fees
secondly
austrian
credit
cards
come
with
chip
and
pin
send
you
a
text
message
whenever
they
are
charged
and
require
two
factor
authentication
through
a
phone
on
d
secure
enabled
sites
local
services
also
can
charge
you
directly
from
your
bank
account
through
an
api
provided
by
banks
that
require
two
factor
authentication
to
confirm
a
payment
as
of
recently
the
use
of
nfc
for
payments
is
also
going
up
tremendously
and
readers
for
them
pop
up
everywhere
the
advantage
obviously
being
that
you
cannot
skim
the
credit
card
number
and
pin
from
them
most
of
my
transactions
are
also
in
the
sepa
region
which
means
they
are
free
and
clear
within
a
business
day
the
ones
that
leave
sepa
i
have
transferwise
for
which
is
beating
bitcoin
in
costs
and
predictability
when
going
cross
border
if
you
need
to
convert
from
and
to
real
world
currency
on
both
ends
in
my
world
bitcoin
seems
quite
useless
why
is
this
relevant
this
topic
is
relevant
because
smaller
scale
open
source
projects
definitely
could
benefit
from
financial
support
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
gittip
aka
gratipay
and
bountysource
the
reason
for
this
is
that
they
make
it
easy
to
contribute
money
for
open
source
projects
and
the
companies
behind
them
are
very
nice
and
straightforward
to
work
with
they
will
make
sure
that
the
model
is
watertight
and
legal
i
can
make
sure
that
all
paperwork
is
in
order
so
that
it
causes
no
problem
for
either
the
supporters
gratipay
bountysource
or
me
i
don
t
mind
if
people
use
bitcoin
for
supporting
me
but
i
do
not
want
to
touch
this
thing
because
it
just
makes
it
more
complicated
than
dealing
with
a
real
currency
for
me
sleeping
well
is
an
important
part
of
my
life
and
sleeping
well
works
better
if
i
do
not
have
to
worry
about
such
things
bitcoin
is
the
wild
westbitcoin
by
itself
if
it
s
not
going
through
a
system
like
coinbase
is
wild
west
and
i
don
t
mean
that
in
a
good
way
a
perfect
example
for
this
is
the
already
mentioned
tip
commit
project
which
is
my
favorite
example
of
a
terrible
service
lately
it
collects
money
unasked
on
behalf
of
other
projects
collects
of
the
amount
donated
and
spams
people
with
mails
to
redeem
their
collected
tips
if
anyone
would
run
this
service
with
real
money
they
would
instantly
run
into
regulatory
problems
rightfully
so
first
of
all
there
is
the
problem
of
what
happens
with
unredeemed
currency
there
are
strict
laws
in
place
in
all
western
countries
for
this
sort
of
thing
because
this
service
is
using
bitcoin
however
it
will
manage
to
fly
under
the
radar
for
a
long
time
however
i
don
t
have
enough
time
on
my
hand
to
deal
with
them
and
i
don
t
want
to
spend
money
on
getting
rid
of
them
either
but
if
they
would
be
doing
this
with
real
currency
i
would
not
have
to
because
they
would
need
to
use
a
payment
system
which
is
pressured
by
banks
to
prevent
this
sort
of
thing
from
happening
if
you
start
handling
real
money
and
you
have
large
sums
going
in
and
out
of
accounts
there
will
be
signals
firing
that
will
ask
you
about
the
nature
of
your
business
and
if
you
have
a
license
for
it
if
it
however
is
bitcoin
or
any
other
crypto
currency
it
can
avoid
this
entirely
in
my
fancy
world
where
i
live
in
this
is
not
a
good
thing
if
you
have
a
completely
broken
piece
of
country
then
i
can
imagine
that
you
are
suspicious
of
regulation
and
this
sort
of
thing
but
for
me
regulation
is
what
keeps
my
world
running
and
working
personally
i
believe
that
bitcoin
is
a
terrible
currency
or
not
a
currency
at
all
but
i
can
see
how
it
might
be
useful
for
inter
bank
asset
exchange
and
transaction
clearing
i
would
believe
that
in
this
space
innovation
will
happen
and
that
bitcoin
will
have
quite
a
bit
of
impact
something
like
the
blockchain
might
be
nice
to
see
in
the
future
you
can
t
ignore
bitcoini
do
not
care
about
bitcoin
and
until
recently
i
have
been
able
to
avoid
it
entirely
through
this
tip
commit
madness
however
all
the
sudden
i
was
forced
to
deal
with
it
and
i
did
not
enjoy
the
experience
in
my
books
bitcoin
is
an
incredible
overvalued
first
generation
quot
thing
quot
that
i
just
don
t
care
about
but
please
don
t
make
me
care
about
it
bitcoin
for
me
feels
like
a
cult
the
vocal
people
in
the
community
seem
like
they
don
t
actually
care
about
bitcoin
but
they
want
to
see
it
succeed
so
that
their
quot
investment
quot
makes
a
profit
i
did
not
even
care
about
the
tip
commit
thing
any
more
by
the
time
it
was
submitted
to
reddit
the
issue
was
already
closed
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
because
i
did
not
want
to
waste
more
time
with
it
but
all
the
sudden
i
got
email
and
comments
the
reddit
post
had
the
awesome
title
this
guy
is
complaining
about
tip
commit
please
help
educate
about
bitcoin
i
do
not
want
to
be
educated
about
bitcoin
i
have
been
following
the
bitcoin
project
since
before
asic
mining
by
now
i
have
read
all
the
arguments
what
i
actually
wantif
you
want
to
make
a
truly
useful
service
for
open
source
make
something
like
bountysource
but
improve
upon
it
make
a
service
which
allows
developers
to
register
their
open
source
projects
with
a
support
platform
then
allow
those
developers
to
setup
a
split
between
the
project
itself
and
contributors
for
instance
then
allow
users
to
put
bounties
on
items
in
the
bug
tracker
when
a
bug
is
fixed
and
accepted
the
patch
author
gets
the
and
the
project
gets
the
for
merging
the
fix
patch
and
for
maintaining
it
in
the
future
this
keeps
the
gamification
out
and
makes
the
process
very
transparent
for
everybody
right
now
my
problem
with
bountysource
is
that
i
am
afraid
it
would
bring
up
the
topic
of
money
too
much
and
complicate
things
why
did
you
not
merge
my
fix
patch
why
did
you
do
it
yourself
where
is
my
money
etc
but
whatever
you
do
do
not
make
bitcoin
your
feature
solve
an
actual
problem
and
solve
it
in
a
way
that
i
can
declare
my
taxes
and
sleep
well
over
it
open
source
is
already
stressful
enough
fantasy
coins
on
my
tax
declaration
are
not
making
my
life
easier
